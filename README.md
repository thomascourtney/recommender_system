# Medical recommender system


Crafted an innovative medical recommender system algorithm using Python library scispaCy. The model starts with raw medical text questions, undergoing meticulous standardization, cleansing, and TF-IDF vectorization. Employing K-Means clustering on a dataset of 3718 raw question-answer pairs, it accurately categorizes questions by type and focus, monitoring performance by utilizing the Silhouette Score. The model retrieves user query answers based on similarity, presenting them in ascending order. Demonstrated success with 1000 distinct clusters and scalability, handling a dataset of 47,457 questions.
